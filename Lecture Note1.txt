 Scoring The Tuckman Team Maturity Questionnaire Electronically  
Erin Barkema1 and John W. Moran2 
October 2013  
Description:  
The Forming � Storming � Norming � Performing  model of group development was first 
proposed by Bruce Tuckman in 1965, who maintained that these phases are all necessary and 
inevitable in order for the team to grow, to face up to challenges, to tackle problems, to find 
solutions, to plan work, and to deliver results .3 Today public h ealth departments are employing 
the teaming concept on a regular basis to make quality improvements to their critical processes. 
Team leaders and managers need to understand how teams mature and when to intervene when 
things  are not progressing as desired.  
When to Use:  
The purpose of the Tuckman Model is to identify and  understand what stage of the teamwork 
that a team is operating in.  It can be used at any point in the teaming process to build awareness 
of how the team�s maturity and develop strategies to move it forward. The  team is administered a 
questionnaire contain ing statements about teamwork .4 Each team member score s each of the 32 
questions using the following scale to indicate how often their team displays each indicated 
behavior:

 Questionnaire:  
1. ���  We try to have set procedures or protocols to ensure that things are orderly and run 
smoothly (e.g. minimize interruptions; everyone gets the opportunity to have their 
say).  
2. ���  We are quick to get on with the task on hand and do not spend too much ti me in the 
planning stage.  
3. ���  Our team feels that we are all in it together and shares responsibilities for the team's 
success or failure.  
4. ���  We have thorough procedures for agreeing on our objectives and planning the way we 
will perform our tasks.  
5. ���  Team members are afraid or do not like to ask others for help.  
6. ���  We take our team's goals and objectives literally, and assume a shared understanding.  
7. ���  The team leader tries to keep order and contributes to the task at hand.  
8. ���  We do not have fixed procedures, we make them up as the task or project progresses.  
9. ���  We generate lots of ideas, but we do not use many because we fail to listen to them and 
reject them without fully understanding them.  
10. ���  Team members do not fully trust the other team members and closely monitor others 
who are working on a specific task.  
11. ���  The team leader ensures that we follow the procedures, do not argue, do not interrupt, 
and keep to the point.  
12. ���  We enjoy working together;  we have a fun and productive time.  
13. ���  We have accepted each other as members of the team.  
14. ���  The team leader is democratic and collaborative.  
15. ���  We are trying to define the goal and what tasks need to be accomplished.  
16. ���  Many of the team members have their own ideas about the process and personal 
agendas are rampant.  
17. ���  We fully accept each other's strengths and weakness es. 
18. ���  We assign specific roles to team members (team leader, facilitator, time keeper, note  
taker, etc.).  
19. ���  We try to achieve harmony by avoiding conflict.  
20. ���  The tasks are very different from what we imagined and seem very difficult to 
accomplish.  
21. ���  There are many abstract discussions of the concepts and issues, which make some 
members impatient with these discussions.  
22. ���  We are able to work through group problems.  
23. ���  We argue a lot even though we agree on the real issues.  
24. ���  The team is often tempted to go above the original scope of the project.  
25. ���  We express criticism of others constructively.  
26. ���  There is a close attachment to the team.

28. ���  The goals we have established seem unrealistic.

proud to be on the team.

 Scoring:  
Once the questionnaire is scored by each team member the next step is to transfer all the score s 
that were given for an  item on the questionnaire  to the score sheet below . When you have entered 
all the scores for each question, total each of the four columns.  
Forming  
Stage  Item Score   Storming

Scoring it Electronically:  Scoring these questions manually is a tedious process and can result 
in data entry errors. To help simplify the process an electronic scoring tool has been developed 
and is explained in the next section.  The electronic tool separates  the 32 questions into their 
Tuckman team maturity categories and each respondent�s (R) score i s entered for each question.  
The questionnaire is designed to help you assess what stage your team normally operates. The 
lowest score possible for a ny individual in any  stage is 8 (Almost never) while the highest score 
possible for a stage is 40 (Almost always).  Page 4
